"""Browser teleoperation over WebRTC.

Serves a single-page client (``static/index.html`` and ``static/teleop.js``)
plus a ``POST /offer``
signaling endpoint, then talks WebRTC with the browser:

* key events arrive on a data channel labelled ``keys`` as JSON
  ``{"type": "keydown" | "keyup", "key": <KeyboardEvent.key>}`` and are handed
  to ``main`` through the ``on_key`` callback as
  ``("press" | "release", name)``, the shape the teleoperation core consumes;
* the key bindings go the other way on a data channel labelled ``help``: the
  node opens it and sends :data:`~.keymap.HELP_TEXT` once, so the page shows the
  current bindings even when a different host served it;
* MuJoCo camera frames flow the other way too: ``main`` pushes the JPEG payload
  of every ``image`` input via :meth:`WebTeleopServer.push_jpeg` and each
  connected browser receives them as a live video track.

For deployments where another service hosts the page and brokers signaling,
:meth:`WebTeleopServer.negotiate_oneshot` answers a single offer handed in at
startup and writes the answer to a TCP socket, with no HTTP server at all; if
the browser does not connect within a timeout it raises, so the node exits
rather than stranding.

Everything — the HTTP server, WebRTC, and the dora polling loop in ``main`` —
runs on one asyncio loop, so ``push_jpeg`` and the ``on_key`` callback are
plain same-loop calls and no locking is involved anywhere.

If a browser goes away mid-hold (tab closed, network drop), the keys it held
are released server-side, so a lost client can never leave the robot moving.
